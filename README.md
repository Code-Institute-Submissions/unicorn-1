Unicorn Issue Tracker
===
**Milestone Project Five: Full Stack Frameworks - Code Institute**

The Unicorn Issue Tracker is a project established to provide care for clients looking to have their computer-based bugs exterminated! The site provides a free debugging service to any and all users who need their computer’s hardware or software wiped of bugs. The site offers clients the opportunity to explain and describe their bug-related problems to our team who will then study the problem and endeavour to solve the issue. Unicorn is user-friendly and uses attributes such as like buttons and view counters to better understand what the user wants from the site and how we can make our clients’ experience even better. Not only does Unicorn offer a free debugging service out of courtesy to their users, but the enterprise hopes that through this goodwill, patrons will also contribute to the business’ on-going expansion through donation. This is a similar business model to something like a Patreon page where more services and features can be offered to the site as it grows with continued support. 


UX
---
Unicorn was created as a viable way for users to have their computer bugs inspected and solved with little to no financial strain on the user. The idea of the site is to eliminate the need for face-to-face interaction when solving issues such as bugs and instead relying upon online tools such as contact forms and Skype chats which help a debug team to understand and pinpoint the problem using educated assumption and experience to achieve their goals. Unicorn is very much aimed at the user who wants to collaborate to solve their problem. Through resources such as descriptive forms, screenshots and good communication with users, a team of developers can work out a problem without the need to physically handle the user’s personal computer. This kind of problem-solving resource, of course, is invaluable in the world of technology. A start-up like Unicorn would be a perfect companion business to a conglomerate such as Apple or a small IT firm just starting out. In both cases, their objectives are the same: Unicorn is an opportunity to keep costs low and problem-solving time to a minimum. 

To avail of all the features available on Unicorn, users must register and log in into the site via the respective webpages marked **Register** and **Login**. A user who registers must provide their email address, a username and two separate password confirmations before being approved as a valid site user. Login, however, only requires the user’s username and password credentials. A registered user will also notice that the navigation bar options when logged changed to include more user-orientated features.

The site’s **Navigation Bar** is a constant across all of Unicorn’s webpages. Users can navigate between pages using this feature. The Unicorn brand logo is also default link back to the Home Page should a user wish to return.

From the website’s **Home Page**, the user is greeted, in the simplest of ways, with exactly what Unicorn offers: A free debugging service and additional future features made possible by user contribution. I believe the simplicity of this presentation and layout makes the site more viable to users, and the lack choice makes the experience more inclusive as opposed to overwhelming the user with options. A user who wishes to avail of the free debugging service may click the text below the image of the bug and a user who wishes to contribute to the growth of the site can click the dollar sign on the right.

Users who opt for the free debugging option will be redirected to the **Debugging Menu**. From this menu, users can choose which action they want to perform from three options: Debug For Free!; Arrange A Skype Call; Just A Query. Each option is tailored to facilitate users who immediately have their computer debugged or simply want to query the procedure. The page includes a Search Bar to filter choices (though only three are available, this search option will become necessary as these options grow over time). Users are also encouraged rate these options through the upvote system of how helpful they have found these options. Each option will lead to a contact page when the user clicks the READ MORE button.

Users who have clicked READ MORE are then redirected to the **Debug Contact Page** where they are asked to describe their issue or query. The prompts used for this form were chosen specifically to garner as much information from the user as possible from their query. Image upload is also an option to provide visual aid of the problem itself. Users looking to thoroughly or vaguely describe their issue or concern will find this form facilitates both avenues. After submitting the necessary information, the user is redirected to a Thank You page which assures them that their information has been received and that they will be contacted shortly. The status of their query will also appear as PENDING.

Users opting to visit the **Future Features** page will be presented with similar set of choices, but a slightly different layout to better contrast the pages. From this menu, users can choose from three options of what they would like to donate to. Options include: Faster Debugging; Daily Update; Events. All with varying descriptions and prices. Each option includes a quantity bar which allows the user to select the quantity of the donation they wish to make. If the user wishes to proceed with payment, the Cart button will take them to their Cart menu. Again, this page includes a Search Bar as well as the upvote option similar to the Debug Menu. 

Users redirected to the **Cart Menu** will be greeted with their cart’s total spend as well as the number of items in their cart (which also appears next to the navigation bar’s cart icon). Users who wish to amend their cart’s item quantity can do so through the amend option and the option to go back to Future Features is available through the Keep Shopping message. Users who wish to proceed to checkout can click the Checkout button underneath one of their chosen items.

Users entering the **Checkout Menu** will again be presented with the contents of their cart and the total spend of their cart’s items, but checkout now prompts the user to include their credit or debit card details for payment. Upon successful credentials being entered, the user will be redirected back to the Home Page with notification of a successful purchase.

Users looking to give feedback to Unicorn may do so through the site’s **Review Us!** option. Here, the user can compose and submit a publicly anonymous review of how they have found the services of the site, or even just feedback on the website. Users who wish to review Unicorn can do so by clicking the ADD A REVIEW button which will redirect them to another contact form where their review can be composed. Once composed, the user can submit it publicly for other users to read. Each review also includes an Edit option if a user wishes to change aspects of their review later. Reviews also include a view counter so that the composer can see how many people their review is reaching. This is important for users who want their opinions heard not just by the site, but by other users. All reviews will be listed on the Review Us! page.

Finally, users who wish to become part of the Unicorn family can do so through the **Apply!** Option in the website’s footer. This option will take a potential applicant to a form designed to collect information about the applicant as well as a space to compose his or her Cover Letter and attach their Curriculum Vitae for consideration. Similar to the Debug form, once submitted, Users will be thanked for their application and receive a PENDING status update.

You can find **mockups** of how this project was planned and envisioned to look below and also in my GitHub under the mockups folder.






Existing Features
---

In this section, I will briefly describe each user available feature which this project has to offer.

* **Navigation Bar** - Allows users to navigate between web pages on the site using marked buttons.
* **Side Navigation bar** - A responsive navigation bar which will offer the same standard navigation for smaller devices.
* **Sign Up!** – A page which prompts the user for their email address, a username, and two separate password confirmations before registering them to the site.
* **Log in Page** – A page which prompts the user for their username and Password. Log in is a requirement for certain features of this website.
* **Future Features Menu** – A page which displays the website’s Future Features – Services that will become available to users if enough money is donated. 
* **View-Counter** – A number display signifying the number of visits a page receives. 
* **Like Button** – A thumb icon used to count and display the number of times a user likes something. 
* **Quantity Bar** – An input bar which will allow the user to input their desired quantity of a future feature service.
* **Cart Icon** – Once a quantity of a feature is added to the user’s cart, they will be reminded of their pending purchase by a numbered icon in the navbar.
* **Cart** – A page which displays any and all items added to the cart from the future features page along with the quantity of those items and their total price. Cart also includes a link to the Checkout page.
* **Checkout** – A page dedicated to customer payment. The user is again greeting with the items they chose from future features along with the quantity and total price before being prompted to give their personal information debit or credit card details. 
* **Debug Menu** – Similar to the Future Features menu, Debug Menu provides a list of options to the user including their courtesy debugging procedure, the organisation of a friendly Skype call, or if the user simply wishes to query the team about something. 
* **Describe Your Bug Menu** – A menu which prompts the user to describe their issue. The form is composed in order to get necessary contact details from the user, a description of the user’s issue, and, if they like, an Image (screenshot) of their bug to better understand how to approach the issue. Once the form is sent, the user is redirected to a new page.
* **Review Us** – A blog spot that is kept anonymous where users can compose and share their experience and overall opinions of the site. Each review can be edited and a view counter is added to understand where attention needs to be paid.
* **Join the Team!** – A form kept at the footer of each webpage for users who wish to join the debugging team. In essence, a job application which will allow the user to compose a cover letter and attach a CV for the site’s admins to consider. 
* **Search Bar** – Allows users to filter their service search through key words.

**Features Left to Implement**
* One feature which I gravely regretful could not be included in this project was a password reset function. For this reason, it was my decision to leave the feature out of the project. It’s a decision I stand by because if it couldn’t function sufficiently, then there was no point including it. I could not figure out the procedure to send an email once the reset was triggered as I was shown in tutorial, and despite asking tutors and student support for assistance, I regret to inform that nobody provided me with any help or assistance. However, I hope to better understand and implement this feature to the project as soon as I can.

* Due to time constraint, I also could not include the graph and full user transparency section discussed in the assignment outline. I prioritized other parts of this project which I felt needed the attention and which needed to be implemented as best they could before submission. I regretfully could not get to this part of the assignment in time. I stand by my work and I hope to implement this feature as soon as I can.

Deployment
---
I could not properly deploy this app through Heroku. I found the procedure too difficult to manage with the AWS bucket. I tried to deploy it through GitHub pages, but I accidentally created a page which only displayed the README.md and could not figure out how to change the default page. It was only afterwards that I realised that I didn’t have the required ‘index.html’ file which you need to set as the default page. This is no consolation, but I have included screenshots of the website for your consideration. I am aware that this is simply not good enough and I am so sorry for this blunder. If you give me the opportunity, I’m sure I could show you the website in some other capacity for you to evaluate it. 

In spite of this, my code and all of my commits are available on Github for you to inspect and run locally. Should you require my Cloud9 credentials, please do not hesitate to get in touch. To run this code locally, you can clone this repository from the Clone or Download button at the top of the page and write git clone followed by the cloned URL into an editor of your choosing. To cut ties with GitHub, use git remote rm origin in the terminal.
